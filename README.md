## Notes

The project is based on the React Boilerplate as a template which allows me to quickly start the development

I chose material-ui as the main UI library, but unfortunately don't have enough time to incorporate the custom theme which can provide a nice and consistent UI stlyling

Flexbox (In material-ui it's wrapped as the Grid component) is the main technique for layouting the UI elements

I used redux and redux-saga to manage the global state and handle the side effects

I used jest as the test framework for unit tests, and added snapshot tests for all the components 

Localization could be easily implemented by i18n library

Don't have much time to add comments in the code...
